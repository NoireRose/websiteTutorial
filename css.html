        position: relative; (similar to position: static;) Modifiable left, right, up and down tag(s). Relative to its original position (static position).
        
        position: absolute; (similar to relative)  Modifiable left, right, up and down tag(s).
        absolute element(s) will reference parent element(s) instead of top left corner, if parents position value is assigened any other position tag other than static.
        
        position: fixed; Always references page / top left corner (no matter parent element); stays in same position when you scroll.

        position: sicky; (combination of relative and fixed position). Both references parent element (left, right, up and down) and stays in same position when you scroll.

        class="" can have multiple calls class="one two" would be called .one{} & .two{} in css.
        id="" can only have one unique call (isn't enforced / 'id' should rarly be used).

        Can cast to child elements using    .parent .child{}
        Can multi-select elements using    .some-child, .some-child... {}
        * parents all elements in a given page. Main use is to default font-family for all elements    * {font-family: Arial;}

    <!--
        % - given % of parent element
        em - is based off of font-size (dunno how exactly this work, semi-complicated)
        rem - (similar to em but scales off the font-size from the root of your document)
        px - is based off of screen pixels
    -->
    <!--
        Specificity level:
        inline:style(s) -> id -> class -> base-element

        css reads from top to bottem.
        Tags of same level that reference same element, the bottem reference will override any above it (specifically anything that overlaps between the calls).

        Ex. of inline:style    <div style="color: red;">something</div>
